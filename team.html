		<p>I am a fourth-year Computer Science major at the Univserity of California, San Diego. 
		My goal in life is to have a house full of puppies and not having to look at the price of
		food when ordering at a restaurant. I'm a big fan of anime and
		good food. Programming is cool I guess.</p>

		<p>I study Computer Science at UCSD, and I love to travel and experience new foods and
		culture! When it comes to life outside the library and school, I'm a big fan of video games and 
		anime as well as going to the gym. If there's one thing that would make my life complete, it would
		be to see Kobe Bryant in person. </p>
